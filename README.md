# Fashion MNIST Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The dataset consists of grayscale images representing different clothing items, and the goal is to train a model that accurately classifies them into categories.

## Features
- **Dataset Loading**: Utilizes the Fashion MNIST dataset from TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and reshaping of images.
- **CNN Model Architecture**: Implements a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trains the model and evaluates its accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Displays sample images and training metrics.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is automatically downloaded via TensorFlow/Keras.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Normalize images and reshape them for CNN input.
3. **Train the Model**: Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the CNN.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Check accuracy and loss graphs.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model for classifying new images.
